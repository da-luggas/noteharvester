# NoteHarvester - Apple Books highlight exporter written in Swift

Since Apple removed the ability to bulk export the highlights and notes you create within the Apple Books application, third-party options have to be used to perform this simple task. A very effective solution is **NoteHarvester**, the easy-to-use and macOS native Apple Books highlights exporter.
